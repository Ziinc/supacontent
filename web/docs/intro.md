Supacontent is the a content-centric feature framework for Supabase apps. Each feature is pluggable and integrates with any existing Supabase project.

Supacontent ships with an npm package that provides a cli for working with the framework.

### Why?


**Integration into existing supabase projects**, allowing existing features and apps to query the content through the same supabase client interface.

**Migrations are automatically handled**, allowing the developer to focus on the UI instead of the database/api building.

**No hosting lock in**, entire supabase stack can be self hosted or outsourced to a supabase(company)-managed database.




### Getting Started

Requirements:

- npm and node
- dbmate (if self-managed or platform-managed)
