Supacontent is the a content-centric feature framework for Supabase apps. Each feature is pluggable and integrates with any existing Supabase project.

Supacontent ships with an npm package that provides a cli for working with the framework.

### Why?

**Integration into existing supabase projects**. Existing features and apps can directly query data through the same familiar Supabase client interface.

**No more re-inventing the wheel for eacn new project**. Focus on the value-added feature buildling, instead of boilerplate functionality.

**Migrations are automatically handled**. Spend your development hours on your UI instead of database/api wrangling.

### Getting Started

Requirements:

- npm and node
- dbmate (if self-managed or platform-managed)
